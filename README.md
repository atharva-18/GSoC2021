Google Summer of Code Project at Open Robotics - New GUI Widgets in Ignition Gazebo

This repository describes my work during the Google Summer of Code 2021 with Open Robotics.

## Project Description

In the summer of 2021, we worked on developing new visualization capabilities for the Ignition Gazebo Robotics Simulator, using GUI widgets.

In the past, developing simulations worlds was a trial and error process, and users often had to provide computed values for robot inertia, joints, and mass properties, and hope that they will work in the simulation directly. If the physicsl behavior of the robot differed from what the user expected, there was no way to visualize what went wrong in the simulation world.

Due to the growing user base of the newer simulator, with finding its applications in the industry and competitions such as the DARPA SubT challenge, it was becoming imperative to add capabilities to visualize values coming from the physics engine of Gazebo. Hence, this project was undertaken to add new features to visualize the robot inertia, mass, joints, and more at runtime.
